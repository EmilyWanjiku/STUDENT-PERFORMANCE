# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE
#  Student Pass/Fail Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on their academic and demographic features. We use machine learning algorithms to perform binary classification on the [Student Performance Dataset]

##  Dataset

- File: student-mat.csv
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Target column: G3 (Final Grade), which we converted into a binary variable:
  - Pass = 1 if G3 ≥ 10
  - Fail = 0 if G3 < 10

---

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas
   - Handled missing values (none found)
   - Encoded categorical variables using pd.get_dummies()

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Used correlation analysis to select features highly related to G3
   - Selected top correlated features for model input

3. **Created Binary Target**
   - Created a new column Pass from G3
   - Dropped `G3` since it's no longer needed

4. **Model Training**
   - Split the data into training and test sets (80/20)
   - Trained two models:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Classifier**

5. **Evaluation**
   - Used:
     - Accuracy
     - F1-Score
     - Confusion Matrix

## Model Comparison

| Metric              | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Accuracy            |  89.9%       | 88.6%          |
| F1-score (Pass)     | 0.92         | 0.91           |
| Precision (Pass)    | 0.94              | 0.92           |

**Final Choice**: **Logistic Regression** is the better model for this task due to its higher accuracy and F1-score.
